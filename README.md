# Step counter challenge

Imagine we're building a fitness app and we want to encourage our users to be more active with a little friendly competition based on step counters. Each month, we'd like to announce the users with the highest step count in each city. As input we have two files. One contains user information including names and addresses. The other has columns for user ID, date and step count. Your task is to generate the step challenge leaderboard, which shows the top 3 steppers of the month for each city along with their total step count for that month.

Use any tools you want. Be prepared to talk through your solution.
